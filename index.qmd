The purpose of this webpage is to provide a simple calculation of likely monthly 
energy costs for UK domestic energy customers from October 2022 to September
2023 based on a given level of energy consumption using public domain information
about future domestic energy prices.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Estimated cost is not actual cost

This is an indicative simulation of potential energy costs; it is not designed
or intended to accurately predict costs, see the [methodology](#methodolgy) for
more details.

:::

## Your consumption

Use the input/sliders below to provide your annual energy usage in
kilowatt-hours (kWh), you can find this on the latest bill from your energy
supplier. The defaults provided here represent the figures used in the Ofgem
price cap methodology for the average household (3,100 kWh for electricity and
12,000 kWh for gas).

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
//| layout-ncol: 2

viewof elec_usage = Inputs.range(
  [0, 20000],
  { label: "Annual electricity consumption (kWh):", value: 3100, step: 100}
)

viewof gas_usage = Inputs.range(
  [0, 20000],
  { label: "Annual gas consumption (kWh):", value: 12000, step: 100}
)

```

## Methodology

On Friday 26 August 2021 Ofgem, the UK energy regulator, 
[announced a rise in the price cap](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/26/ofgem-raises-energy-price-cap-to-3549) 
for domestic energy. On the same day, energy consultancy
[Cornwall Insight released updated forecasts](https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1563049747354910720) 
for the future values of Ofgem's price cap in 2023. Reporting on the price has
largely been focussed on the estimate of the annual cost for the "average"
domestic customer, which for the new price cap is estimated as £3,549.

While averages can be useful indicators they do not help customers understand
their own situation. Similarly, the annual figure does not necessarily help
customers understand their potential costs, especially as we head into the most 
energy intensive period of the year, and have significant increases forecast in
the price cap going forward.

This calculator provides a simple approach to estimate energy costs using Ofgem's
announced price cap for October 2022 to December 2022 and Cornwall Insight's
forecasts of changes to the price cap for January 2023 through to September 2023.

### Estimating energy usage
The calculator uses overall UK electricity consumption[^1] and gas supply[^2]
figures published by the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy
(BEIS) to estimate the pattern of energy usage throughout the year. This is done
by calculating the relative energy use by fuel for each month of each calendar
year from 2010 to 2021, see @fig-relative-usage.

An average of these relative monthly consumption figures
is then taken, to smooth out fluctuations in annual figures due to different
weather patterns, and then converted to a proportion of annual energy consumption
for each fuel. These proportions are then applied to the user provided annual
electricity and gas consumption, to estimate usage by month.

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| output: false
energy_trends = aq.loadCSV("data/energy_trends.csv")
months = ["J", "F", "M", "A", "M", "J", "J", "A", "S", "O", "N", "D"]
```

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| label: fig-relative-usage
//| fig-cap: Relative energy monthly usage
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    domain: [0, 1],
    label: "",
    tickFormat: "0%"
  },
  x: {
    label: "",
    ticks: 12,
    tickFormat: d => months[d - 1]
  },
  marginBottom: 50,
  grid: true,
  facet: {
    data: energy_trends,
    x: "fuel",
    label: ""
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(energy_trends, {x: "month", 
                                  y: "value",
                                  stroke:"fuel"}),
    Plot.lineY(
      energy_trends,
        Plot.groupX({y: "mean"}, {y: "value", x: "month", stroke: "fuel",
        strokeWidth: 3, curve: "basis"}),
    )
  ],
  color: {
    legend: true,
    type: "categorical",
    domain: ["electricity", "gas"], 
    range: ["#E8C027", "#1092E8"]
  }
})
```

#### Estimated usage is not actual usage

Even though you can provide your own annual energy consumption the monthly
estimates are unlikely to accurately predict how your energy consumption varies
over the year. The underlying statistics are for total UK energy usage, so
including both industrial, commercial and domestic uses.

Your energy use will also vary by the size of your household as well as the
size, age and construction of your property.

:::

### Estimating energy costs
There are two sources for future energy costs: (i) Ofgem's announced price cap
for October 2022 to December 2022, and (ii) Cornwall Insight's forecast of the
future value of the price cap that will apply from January 2023 to September
2023.

Ofgem's methodology for calculating the energy price cap is very complicated,
and the price cap that applies to your energy bill will vary depending on the
region of the UK you live in as well as how you pay for your electricity. This
calculator uses the GB average figures provided in the Ofgem pricing model
spreadsheet for the "Other methods" payment method (e.g. direct debit payment),
specifically £1,693.02 for electricity and £1,785.66 for gas.

Cornwall Insight have published regular forecasts for the price cap for dual-fuel
direct debit customers in recent months, the latest[^3] being released the same
day as the Ofgem price cap rise was announced. Their latest forecast is of a
price cap of £5,387 for January 2023 to March 2023, £6,616 for April 2023 to
June 2023, and £5,897 for July 2023 to September 2023.

The Cornwall Insight figures are translated into separate figures for gas and
electricity by using the fuel mix implied by the methodology of the Ofgem model
spreadsheet's indicative dual-fuel cost, that is 51.3% gas and 48.7% electricity.

The values of the cap for gas and electricity are then converted into implied 
per kWh costs using the Ofgem model annual consumption assumption of 3,100 kWh
for electricity and 12,000 kWh for gas.

These unit costs are then applied to the estimated usage to generate monthly
costs per fuel, which are then aggregated to calculate the monthly and annual
total cost.

::: {.callout-important}

#### Estimated cost is not actual cost

The specific level of the price cap that applies to you depends on where you
live and your payment method. The price cap is a cap on the unit price of energy,
it is not a cap on the maximum amount you will pay, the more energy you use the
more you will pay.

The price cap figures used are GB average figures, each energy supply region
has its own cap. Based on figures in the published Ofgem model, if you pay via
prepayment meter your costs could be around 2% higher, if you pay on receipt of
a bill from your provide your costs could be around 6% higher.

Energy companies are still studying the price cap announcement and it is unclear
what specific prices they will charge their customers.

This calculator does not take account of any of the government's support
measures for energy bill support or the cost of living.

The Cornwall Insight forecasts of the price are not guaranteed, they are
estimates based on forecasts of future wholesale energy costs and other inputs
to the Ofgem price cap modelling. These forecasts may rise further if wholesale
energy prices continue to rise, or they may reduce if future wholesale energy
prices do not rise as high as forecast.

:::

### Why are your figures different from X, Y, Z
Largely it will be a difference of methodology. The sections above explain the
steps taken to build the calculator and the code is open source. It has not been
possible to review the specific methodology/code driving other calculators.

### Further information

The code for the this calculator is published on [Github]() and a more detailed
discussion of the methodology can be [read here]().
